I created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the work day (8AM-5PM). This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The time blocks are color coded to indicate whether it occured in the past(gray), present(pink) or future (purle). Events can be entered to a specific line and the 'save button' saves them to the local storage.
